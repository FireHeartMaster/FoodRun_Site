# FoodRun_Site

This small project consists of a very simple site that I made for a game I developed called FoodRun.

I published this game recently on Google PlayStore and had a very good feedback given it's the first game I publish and that I didn't have any support other than my enthusiasm, which I plan to carry with me in the future as so essential it is in game development. 

Even if I'm not publicly sharing the files for the game, here you have the simple HTML file that composes this simple site. Of course I made a great use of CSS, but not exactly CSS... To have everything simple and in a single file, everything I would have put in a CSS file, I put it inside the HTML tags. Of course I also used a lot of w3.css "functionalities".

I invite you to visit the site in the following adress and check it out:
